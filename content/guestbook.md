I adopted the [multiple Git identities pattern](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2023-10-13-organizing-multiple-git-identities) to tidy up my work/personal git usage. Very tidy and neat. Thanks for the prompt!

The guestbook idea also seems neat enough that I persisted through the speed-bump of opening a PR, etc too!

Hi there, this is a cool idea, but what about for people, who does not have a github account?
